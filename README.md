## Overview

In an age where AI continues to push the boundaries of what's possible, benchmarking becomes essential to measure its strengths and identify areas for improvement. TheOctoBench provides a set of 15+ tests spanning multiple categories, including:

- **PhD-level Reasoning:** Complex questions that probe deep understanding.
- **Coding Challenges:** Programming tasks that require generating correct and optimized code.
- **Mathematical Problems:** Numerical and algebraic problem-solving.
- **Translation:** Evaluating language fluency and translation accuracy.
- **Summarization:** Extracting key insights from large texts.
- **Logic Puzzles:** Testing deductive reasoning skills.
- **Definitions & Explanations:** Assessing clarity in defining concepts.
- **Numerical Reasoning:** Validating precision in numerical data.
- **Creative Tasks:** Generating creative writing, poems, and stories.
- **Simulations:** Simulating real-world scenarios like weather forecasts.

The tool interacts with the AI exclusively through its API, making it highly versatile and easily integrable into continuous integration pipelines or research workflows.

## Features

- **Modular Test Suite:** Easily add, remove, or modify test cases.
- **API-Based Testing:** Interact with any AI that provides a RESTful API.
- **Automated Evaluation:** Basic evaluation using keyword matching and scoring.
- **Visual Benchmark Reports:** Generate visual summaries (benchmark photos) using bar charts.
- **Extensible:** Designed for easy integration of new test types and evaluation strategies.
- **Open Source:** Encourages collaboration and contributions from the community.
